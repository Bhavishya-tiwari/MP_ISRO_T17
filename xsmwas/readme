1. Download this folder. That shall function as the standalone application. 
2. The folder contains 'final_data.csv' which shall be used to initialize the classifier. It also contains 'lc_files' folder where all the light curve files go.
3. Run xsmmodgen.py to generate the mlmodel to be used for classification. This is a one time process. Running the script would generate a .pkl file.
4. Ensure all the lightcurve files you want analyzed are present in the 'lc_files' folder. 
5. Run xsmwas.py, specify the preferences for saving the plots and viewing them interactively. Close one plot, if you want to move ahead to analyzing the other.
6. Your lightcurve files have been analyzed!
